# Human-Disease-Prediction using Machine Learning

I developed an integrated system utilizing Machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and orthopaedic conditions based on patient data. Also developed a user-friendly web interface using Steamlit that allowing users to input patient data and obtain real-time disease risk assessments.There I  was exposed to data collection, pre-processing, and feature extraction components of Machine Learning (ML).
For Heart Disease 
      Dataset:  14 attributes , 1025 instances
      MODELS- We used logistic Regression, Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest and SVM. 
For Diabetes
      Dataset-  9 attributes and 768 Instances
      Models â€“ we used Random Forest, Decision Tree, knn and SVM
For Breast Cancer Prediction
      Models - We used logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,K Nearest Neighbour(KNN), Random Forest and SVM.
